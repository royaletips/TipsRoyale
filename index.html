                    <h3>Don't Waste Elixir</h3>
                    <p>If you are at 10 Elixir, play a cheap card (1-2 Elixir) to maintain production. Lost seconds equal an advantage for the enemy.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Trade with Profit</h3>
                    <p>Always aim for your defense to cost less Elixir than the opponent's attack (e.g., destroying a Golem (8) with an Inferno Tower (5) = +3 Elixir advantage!).</p>

                    <h3>Fast Card Cycle</h3>

                <div class="archetype-item">
                    <h4>TANK / Beatdown</h4>
                    <p>Relies on a powerful, expensive tank (Golem, Lava Hound, Mega Knight) played from the back to build a huge "push" in the Double Elixir phase.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="archetype-item">
                    <h4>CYCLE / Fast Cycle</h4>
                    <p>Cheap decks (average cost 2.6 - 3.0). Goal: play the key attack card (e.g., Hog Rider or Mortar) as quickly as possible before the opponent prepares a counter.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="archetype-item">
                    <h4>SIEGE / Siege
                    <p>Utilizes buildings (X-Bow, Mortar) that attack towers from a distance, staying on the safe side of the arena. Requires excellent defense.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="archetype-item">
                    <h4>CONTROL / Control</h4>
                    <p>The goal is to "trade" for an Elixir Advantage in defense, and then counterattack with cards like Miner or Goblin Barrel.</p>

                <li>**Upgrade with Caution:** Focus on upgrading the 8 cards in your main deck. Wasting gold on unused cards will slow you down for years.</li>
                <li>**Save Gems:** NEVER use Gems to speed up chests. Spend them on Global Challenges or shop offers that give the best Gem-to-Gold/Card ratio.</li>
                <li>**Donate = XP and Gold:** Regularly donating cards in the clan is a free and steady supply of Gold and valuable Experience (XP) for a higher King Tower level.</li>

                <li>**Communicate Plays (Emote):** Slightly raising a card (without playing it) shows your ally what you plan, preventing, for example, a double Fireball on a Minion Horde.</li>
                <li>**Double Tank? Double Spell!** If you see your partner playing a tank (e.g., Giant), you should play support (e.g., Wizard). Don't play a second tank ‚Äì that's an invitation for a P.E.K.K.A. counter.</li>
                <li>**Clan Wars:** Actively participate in Clan Wars ‚Äì this is the largest source of Gold and Trade Tokens.</li>
